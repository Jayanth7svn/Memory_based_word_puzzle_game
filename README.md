# Memory Based Word Puzzle Game
```
This is a simple memory-based word puzzle game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game displays an alphabet grid and challenges players to reconstruct a word by remembering the row and column positions of letters.

Based on the user’s input, the game dynamically forms the word from the grid.
The project focuses on improving memory, concentration, and logical thinking using basic game mechanics.
